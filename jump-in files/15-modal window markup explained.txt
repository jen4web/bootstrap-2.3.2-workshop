  To create modal windows, you need two pieces of code.
  http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
  
  In each thumbnail:
  Add  data-toggle="modal" to each LI to bind the HTML to the Javascript.
  
  Add an ID to each modal window and associate it in the href attribute, i.e. href="#raspberries" (where the ID for the modal window is raspberries)
  
  Final code should look like this:
  
  <li class="span3"><a href="#raspberries" class="thumbnail"  data-toggle="modal"><img src="img/thumbs/raspberries.jpg" alt="Raspberries. "></a></li>
  

  
  Now the code for the modal window:
  
          <div id="raspberries" class="modal hide fade" tabindex="-1">
          <div class="modal-header">
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal">Ã—</button>
            <h3>Raspberries</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p><img src="img/large/raspberries.jpg" alt="raspberries!"></p>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-footer">
            <button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
          </div>
        </div>
		
		This code can appear anywhere on the page (so I put it in the bottom of the content area, just above the footer).
		The ID in the outside div must match the href attribute in the thumbnail link.
		The divs with classes of modal-header, modal-body, and modal-footer are strictly for styling and are not required.
		data-dismiss="modal" will close the window, and can be associated with a link or a button.
		You can add additional classes for the buttons as seen on the home page (btn-large, btn-warning) for styling.
